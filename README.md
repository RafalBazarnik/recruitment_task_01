*Project:
Automated tests for Xsolve recruitment task

config.properties files needs to have password and username added

project now uses Firefox driver so it require gecko driver

TODO: screenshots, logging, other drivers, more tests, remove unused code, better readme :)

FOUND ISSUES: 
1) formatting option [*] asterix has unclear purpose - with bbcode turned on and off - it is just it's code
2) info about config like "[img] is ON" does not change on using checkbox - so it is either unrelated to current post editing (global config) or it isn't working as it is expected
3) there seems to be some problem occasionaly appearing in loading drafts and submmiting them - "invalid form" validation message apears - I was unable to recreate this validation error by hand - https://ibb.co/gr6Qbm
